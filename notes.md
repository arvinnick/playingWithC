This repository is just a hands-on experience for me to try to learn C. I am not sure what will happen to my schedule on
my university, therefore I have no hard plan for frequency of updating this repo.<br>
I am using Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, 1988 book named The C Programming Language. 2nd Edition. This file serves
as my notes of reading this book and others are my practices; either an exercise or an education part.

1- In CLion, I have to add the name of the files I want to compile and run in the "CMakeLists.txt" in the line "add_executable"
 inside the parenthesis, after the name of the project. If you want to compile it by yourself, that would be another story.
